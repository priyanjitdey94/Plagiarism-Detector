# Plagiarism-Detector
This plagiarism detector can be used to find similarity between two files. However, it is mainly targeted for source codes.

# Whitespaces, newlines, tabs are detected and ignored for plagiarism testing
# Header files are not considered 
# Macros and preprocessor directives are ignored
# Single and multi line comments are ignored

### Possible ares of improvement:
-> Detect variables and donot consider variable names for testing.
-> For C, C++, JAVA additional checking can be done by testing the assembly code generated after compilation
